# Cloud Database

Google Firebase
- Creates three different tables that the user can interact with and store data.
- Tables are connected to each other

# Development Environment

- React
- Javascript
- Firestore

# Useful Websites

- [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0&hl=en)
- [JS docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# Future Work

- Fix the app using an extremely large amount of reads
- Edit code so that the database updates/deletes data from the other tables when modified.
- Style the app so that it is visually easier to use
